# Semantic changes provide unique insights into how clinicians consider palliative care for malignancy over time!

ABSTRACT:
Importance: Palliative care is known to improve quality of life in advanced cancer. Natural language processing offers insights to how language around palliative care exists in medical notes in the context of metastatic cancer providing insights into evolving practice.

Objective: To investigate relational changes in metastatic cancer and palliative care terminology in the hospital setting over time.

Design: We trained unsupervised word embedding algorithms on each year of inpatient notes to calculate contextual similarities of words related to metastatic cancer (e.g. “mets”, “metastases”, etc.) and palliative care terms (e.g. “palliative care”, “pal care”, etc.) over time. This approach allows for the study of the relationship between metastatic cancer and palliative care over time in clinical notes. We compared change of language around metastases and palliative care to the number of inpatient palliative care consultations at UCSF over the same time period.

Setting: University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).

Participants: Patients ≥18 years hospitalized at any UCSF hospital.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary measure was contextual similarity (cosine similarity) between metastatic and palliative care terms converted into mathematical vector representations. This informs how these terms co-occur in notes. Metastatic terms were combined using point-wise estimates to measure the contextual similarity or distance between vectors of grouped metastatic terms with individual palliative care terms. We performed linear regression to identify changes in contextual similarity of terms over time. We also describe the prevalence of inpatient palliative care consultations over the same study period.

Results: Metastatic terms and palliative care terms were contextually similar over each year. However, these terms decreased in contextual similarity over time in tandem with decreased percentages of palliative care consultations for patients with cancer at UCSF. 

Conclusion: Text in clinical notes offers unique insights into how medical providers describe and consider palliative care in patients with advanced malignancies. Studying the co-occurrence of metastatic and palliative care terms may represent how clinicians are considering and writing about these concepts in conjunction with one another. When coupled with decreasing rates of palliative care consultations, this could represent decreasing considerations of palliative care in patients who might stand to benefit most.
